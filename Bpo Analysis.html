        <img src="images/Call Center_1.jpg" alt="Loan Stats" class="rounded-lg w-full">
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 mt-2">Texas recorded the highest satisfaction score of 7,834, while Wyoming had the lowest score of 6.<br> <br>
        This shows a significant variation in customer experience across different regions.<br> <br>
        Texas showing a high CSAT score suggests customers there are having consistently positive experiences  possibly due to better service quality, quicker resolutions, or experienced agents.

        It helps understand why customers are calling, so the business can respond better.<br><br>
        Billing Questions account for the majority of calls  around 23,000, while Payment Issues and Service Outages each have about 5,000 calls.<br><br> 
        This tells us that billing is the most common concern among customers.

        <img src="images/Call Center_3.jpg" class="rounded-lg w-full">
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 mt-2">Total Calls By Sentiment Tracks The Emotional Tone Or Sentiment Of Customer Interactions - Typically Categorized As Negative, Neutral, Positive, Or Very Positive. This Can Be Based On Speech Analytics, Customer Feedback, Or Ai-driven Sentiment Analysis Of Call Transcripts.<br><br>
        Negative Sentiment Calls Are The Highest, At 11.1K, Indicating Many Customers Were Upset Or Frustrated During Their Interaction. In Contrast, Only 3.2K Calls Were Classified As Very Positive, Where Customers Had A Highly Satisfying Experience.

        It helps businesses understand how customers prefer to reach out, and where the most support load lies.<br><br>
        From the data, the Call Center handles the highest share of interactions at 32%, followed by Chatbot (25%), Email (23%), and Web (20%).<br><br> 
        This means voice support is still the most used channel, but digital support is catching up.

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <section class="p-8 bg-white text-center shadow-inner">
    <h2 class="section-title" style="font-size:18px;">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left mt-2">
      The analysis shows that the call center handled 33K total calls with a total duration of 824K minutes. The majority of calls were related to billing issues, indicating this as the most frequent customer concern. Los Angeles and Baltimore emerged as the top-performing centers in terms of call volume. Texas achieved the highest Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), while sentiment analysis reveals that a large portion of interactions were negative or neutral, signaling the need for better service engagement.       <br><br>

  Suggestions:<br>

  Improve Billing Clarity: Since most calls relate to billing questions, revising billing communication and FAQs can reduce call volume.<br>

  Enhance Training: Conduct skill enhancement programs for agents to improve handling time and sentiment outcomes.<br>

  Leverage Digital Channels: Encourage more use of chatbots and emails to balance call center load.<br>

  Monitor Negative Feedback: Use sentiment insights to identify problem areas and improve service delivery.<br>

  Optimize Call Distribution: Balance workload across centers to improve efficiency and maintain consistent customer satisfaction.
